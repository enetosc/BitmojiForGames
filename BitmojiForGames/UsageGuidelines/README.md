# About this Guide

Bitmoji for Games Usage Guidelines intend to help potential partners properly use the Bitmoji identity assets in games. When we say "Bitmoji identity assets" we mean the Bitmoji word mark, Bitmoji app icon, Bitmoji logo, Bitmoji avatars, Bitmoji artwork, and our other features and product names. 

# Audience

Bitmoji for Games Usage Guidelines are intended for potential partners seeking to use the Bitmoji identity assets in their games. Potential partners should review these guidelines before submitting their games for approval by Bitmoji.

# Bitmoji Asset Usage

* Your app/game may only use the Bitmoji identity assets, including Bitmoji avatars, as provided in the Bitmoji for Games package. Any other usage of Bitmoji identity assets requires our prior written approval.

* Your app/game may only use Bitmoji avatars from the [Snap Games NPCs list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9O2RZpPE2Lf_f5gek7F0C38SYXrtGObKk6oSxlMRFI/edit?usp=sharing) as guides.

* Your app/game may not modify, or allow users to modify, 2D and 3D Bitmoji avatars, expressions, outfits, costumes, accessories, and artwork without our prior written approval.

* Your app/game may adjust the shading and lighting of 3D Bitmoji avatars to adapt to the style of your app/game/marketing art with our approval. No other alterations, including artistic re-interpretation, should be made to the provided avatars and/or Bitmoji branding. 

* Your app/game may not monetize Bitmoji identity assets without our prior written approval. For example, your game cannot charge users to get access to Bitmoji avatars, expressions, outfits, costumes, or accessories.

* Your app/game must adhere to the [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/brand_guidelines.pdf). 

# Designing Your Apps and Marketing Materials

## App Title 

* Your app/game must not use the word "Bitmoji" in the title, unless your app/game is a first party game created by Bitmoji or Snap Inc.

## App Icon 

* The Bitmoji app icon must not be included in your app/game’s icon.

* Your app/game’s icon must not use Snapchat’s Yellow (#FFFC00) or Bitmoji’s Green (#39CA8E).

* Your app/game must not use any of Bitmoji or Snap’s trademarks, logos, or other source-identifiers (e.g., Bitmoji avatar and/or Bitmoji stickers) as part of your brand identity, which includes your app icon, logo, and product design (with the exception of using Jay & Lexi -premium avatars- together in your app icon to show partnership) unless your app/game is a first party game created by Bitmoji or Snap Inc.

## Marketing Materials

* Your app/game may use Jay & Lexi (premium avatars) and the "Bitmoji for Games" logo in splash/title page art.
