# About this Guide

Bitmoji for Games Usage Guidelines intend to help potential partners properly use the Bitmoji identity assets in games. When we say "Bitmoji identity assets" we mean the Bitmoji word mark, Bitmoji app icon, Bitmoji logo, Bitmoji avatars, Bitmoji artwork, and our other features and product names.

# Audience

Bitmoji allows game developers to bring identity and personalization to their gaming environment. To integrate Bitmoji into a game environment, you must comply with the following guidelines:

# Bitmoji Game Content

**Game Content:** Game proposals and content should be PG13+ (no alcohol, explicit violence, blood, sexuality, bullying, harassment, etc.) Your app/game must not include content connected to pornography, illegal activities/marketplaces, or other material that violates the Snap Inc. Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or Privacy Policy.

**Monetization:** Your Game may not monetize Bitmoji identity assets, directly or indirectly, without our prior written approval. For example, your Game may not charge users to access Bitmoji avatars, expressions, outfits, costumes, or accessories.

**Avatar Modification:** Your Game may not modify, or allow users to modify, 2D and 3D Bitmoji avatars, expressions, outfits, costumes, accessories, and artwork without our prior written approval. If you would like to add an accessory the Bitmoji team must approve the accessory/usage, and it may not be monetized for real world currency. In addition, the Bitmoji team cannot guarantee current or future compatibility with Bitmoji avatar styles.

**Outfit Forcing:** If you wish to force players into outfit changes outside of what their Avatar is wearing in other environments, you must give the user the ability to consent to the experience and preview their avatar in a new outfit. You should also expect a latency tax to load this new outfit every time a user plays. If you wish to change players’ headwear, you must submit your proposal for approval, in consideration of religious headwear; the same guidelines above apply.

# Avatar Guidelines

**2D vs. 3D:**

_Example of a **3D** Bitmoji Avatar (center) and 2D Bitmoji Selfie Content (Top Left), Example **2D** Bitmoji Sticker Content_

Bitmoji has a 2D and 3D avatar system, with specific use cases for integrating a 3D Avatar or 2D Content into gaming environments. Games should utilize 3D Bitmoji avatars for player characters and 2D Bitmoji stickers or selfies for leaderboards & GUI. A player’s personal Bitmoji 3D should also be "controlled", meaning it can't be just an identity layer, but one of expression, i.e. your decisions are making the Bitmoji take certain actions, either with players directly controlling their movement, directing their Bitmoji to move, or as controlled emotes in a pvp game (i.e.,[Trivia Party](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QTsxzXiShDFSdGVjNCguGh1HobWIAEye/view?usp=sharing))

**2D**

Bitmoji has three different 2D Avatar styles. When designing Game art or adding non-player characters, you must use Bitmoji Deluxe, as seen below, on the very **left**. Players may use any of the three styles.

If you are utilizing 2D Bitmoji stickers and want to modify any portion of the content, you may only change the background color or add basic textures to the sticker. You may not change the content of a sticker, including swapping out props, changing the Avatar itself, or adding additional text to the sticker.

# NPC Creation

The Bitmoji team has created a [diverse, inclusive cast of characters](https://github.com/Bitmoji/BitmojiForGames/tree/master/Documentation/NonPlayerCharacters) to be used in your Game. If you create additional non-player characters beyond those provided, they must be submitted to the Bitmoji team for approval. NPCs may not be attired in **branded** fashion assets unless you have a contract with the brand allowing the use of said assets in game. For example, the NPCs must not be wearing any Off White, American Eagle, Crocs. You also may not use branded stickers, like our Star Wars pack.

# Designing Your Apps and Marketing Materials

App Title

- Your app/game must not use the word "Bitmoji" in the title, unless your app/game is a first party game created by Bitmoji or Snap Inc.

App Icon

- The Bitmoji app icon must not be included in your app/game’s icon.
- Your app/game’s icon must not use Snapchat’s Yellow (#FFFC00) or Bitmoji’s Green (#39CA8E).
- Your app/game must not use any of Bitmoji or Snap’s trademarks, logos, or other source-identifiers (e.g., Bitmoji avatar and/or Bitmoji stickers) as part of your brand identity, which includes your app icon, logo, and product design (with the exception of using Jay & Lexi -premium avatars- together in your app icon to show partnership) unless your app/game is a first party game created by Bitmoji or Snap Inc.

Game Art

For Game art and marketing purposes, we recommend utilizing our high resolution Bitmoji Avatars; you can find instructions on how to do so [here](https://support.canvas.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408200036244-Using-Bitmojis-for-Marketing-Splash-screens).

- Your app/game may use the "Bitmoji for Games" logo in your marketing materials (e.g., art, messaging, ads, app store screenshots, and other promotional assets). Your app/game may use Jay & Lexi (premium avatars) in splash/title page art.
- Bitmoji stickers must not be used in marketing materials. Marketing materials should illustrate your game’s integration of Bitmoji.
